# Master's Thesis Code Repository
## Working Title: Mini Decoder Adaptation
This is the code repository for my master's thesis. The thesis is based on the paper *Mini-Model Adaptation: Efficiently Extending Pretrained Models to New Languages via Aligned Shallow Training* by Kelly Marchisio, Patrick Lewis, Yihong Chen, Mikel Artetxe ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10503)). 

The basic premise is to transfer the methods that Marchisio et al. propose in this paper from MLMs to decoder-only models. More information will become available on the [website](https://sp-nebel.github.io/mini-decoder-adaptation/) of this project, where I will document my progress and findings. The website is currently under construction.
